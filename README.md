This repository demonstrates a common SQL performance issue caused by using functions within a `WHERE` clause's comparison that are not indexed.  The example query uses the `SUBSTR` function on the `email` column, preventing the use of an index.  The solution shows how to rewrite the query to utilize indexes more efficiently and improve query speed.  This is a critical issue that commonly impacts performance in SQL databases, especially on large tables.
