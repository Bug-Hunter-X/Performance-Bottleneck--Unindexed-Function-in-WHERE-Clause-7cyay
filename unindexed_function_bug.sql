The SQL query uses a function (e.g., `SUBSTR`, `REPLACE`, `UPPER`) within a `WHERE` clause's comparison that isn't indexed.  This prevents the database from using indexes effectively, leading to slow performance, especially on large datasets.  For example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE SUBSTR(email, 1, 5) = 'test@';
```

Indexing `email` won't help here because the `SUBSTR` function modifies the value before the comparison.
